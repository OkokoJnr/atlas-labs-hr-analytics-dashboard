# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The executive leadership of Atlas Labs requires visibilty into the workforce trends, attrition drivers metrics, and employee performance outcomes to support strategic workforce planning.

I developed an end-to-end Human Resource Analytics dashboard in Power BI that:

+ Identified a 16% overall attrition rate
+ Discovered that Sales Department's Sales Representative as the highest turnover role.
+ Found that frequent travelers experience a 24.9% attrition rate.
+ Enabled dynamic tracking of individuals performance review and ratings
+ Highlighted salary disparities across ethnic group.
+ Determined attrition across various categories, experiencing higher attrition across employees below 30 years of Age

The dashboard provides actionable insights to support retention strategy, DEI review and optmizing policies

# BUSINESS PROBLEM
The HR leadership needs answers to:

+ What is the true attrition rate?

+ Which department and roles have the highest turnover?

+ Does travel frequency influence attrition

+ Are there diversity representation or salary equity concerns

+ How can we track individual employee performance over time

+ How should HR prioritize rention efforts


    The challenge was transforming the raw CSV exports into a structured analytical model of answering executive-level workforce questions.
