EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The executive leadership of Atlas Labs requires visibilty into the workforce trends, attrition drivers metrics, and employee performance outcomes to support strategic workforce planning.

I developed an end-to-end Human Resource Analytics dashboard in Power BI that:

+ Identified a 16% overall attrition rate
+ Discovered that Sales Department's Sales Representative as the highest turnover role.
+ Found that frequent travelers experience a 24.9% attrition rate.
+ Enabled dynamic tracking of individuals performance review and ratings
+ Highlighted salary disparities across ethnic group.
+ Determined attrition across various categories, experiencing higher attrition across employees below 30 years of Age

The dashboard provides actionable insights to support retention strategy, DEI review and optmizing policies
