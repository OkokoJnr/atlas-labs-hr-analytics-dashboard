# 🏗  Data & Modeling Approach
1️⃣ Data Architecture Overview

The HR analytics solution was built using a star-schema inspired dimensional model with light snowflaking for rating and satisfaction dimensions.

The model separates:
+	Fact table (transactional performance data)
+	Dimension tables (descriptive employee and classification attributes)
+	Dedicated measures table (centralized DAX logic)
This structure ensures scalability, optimized filtering behavior, and analytical flexibility.

# 2️⃣ Fact Table
📌 FactPerformanceRating
This table captures employee-level performance review events.
Granularity:
One row per employee per review date.
Key Columns:
+	EmployeeID
+	ReviewDate
+	EnvironmentSatisfaction
+	JobSatisfaction
+	ManagerRating
+	RelationshipSatisfaction
+	PerformanceID
This table enables:
+	Time-based review analysis
+	Rating trend tracking
+	Satisfaction pattern analysis
+	Context-aware DAX calculations

# 3️⃣ Dimension Tables
👤 DimEmployee
Contains static employee attributes.
Key attributes:
+	Age & AgeBins
+	Department
+	BusinessTravel
+	DistanceFromHome
+	Attrition
+	ActiveStatus
Purpose:
+	Workforce segmentation
+	Attrition analysis
+	Demographic breakdowns
+	Department-level insights
________________________________________
## 📅 DimDate
Standard calendar dimension used for time intelligence.
Includes:
+	Year
+	Month
+	FiscalMonth
+	FiscalQuarter
+	DayOfWeek
Supports:
+	Hiring trend analysis
+	Review trend analysis
+	Year-over-year comparison
+	Time-based attrition tracking

## 🎓 DimEducationLevel
Stores education classification data.
Enables education-level segmentation analysis.
________________________________________
## ⭐ DimRatingLevel
Separates rating category metadata from numeric values.
Improves:
+	Normalization
+	Model readability
+	Future extensibility
________________________________________
## 😊 DimSatisfiedLevel
Used for satisfaction score categorization.
Supports:
+	Employee engagement analysis
+	Satisfaction-level grouping
+	Rating interpretation

## 4️⃣ Modeling Design Decisions
✔ Dimensional Modeling Strategy
The model follows a star schema structure:
+	Fact table at the center
+	Dimensions filtering inward
+	Single-direction relationships (1 → many)
This design:
+	Improves query performance
+	Prevents ambiguity
+	Maintains predictable filter propagation
+	Aligns with BI best practices
________________________________________
## ✔ Relationship Strategy
+	One-to-many relationships from dimensions to fact table
+	Controlled filter direction to avoid circular dependencies
+	Dedicated Date dimension for time-based analysis
+	Inactive relationships used where alternate date logic was required (via USERELATIONSHIP())
________________________________________
## ✔ Measures Table
A separate _Measures table was created to centralize all DAX measures.
Benefits:
+	Cleaner model layout
+	Easier maintenance
+	Clear separation of logic vs structure
+	Professional BI practice

## 5️⃣ Granularity & Filter Context Management
Understanding granularity was critical in this project.
+	Employee-level metrics (e.g., Attrition) originate from DimEmployee
+	Review-level metrics originate from FactPerformanceRating
+	DistinctCount logic used to avoid duplication
+	Context-aware measures implemented to handle review vs employee aggregation
This ensured accurate KPI reporting across pages.

## 6️⃣ Advanced Techniques Used
+	Context transition with CALCULATE()
+	Alternate relationship activation using USERELATIONSHIP()
+	Dynamic KPI calculations
+	Percentage calculations with DIVIDE()
+	Conditional logic using IF() and ISBLANK()
+	Centralized DAX measure management
